"Type Racer" â€“ Version 1.0**

- First ever upload of the "Type Racer" project, designed to improve typing speed and accuracy through timed text challenges.
- Users must type 60 sentences within a set time limit, striving to achieve the highest possible sentence and word count.
- **New Features Added:**
  - **Color Match Feature**: Highlights the accuracy of typed sentences and words by color-coding individual sentence and word accuracy, giving users immediate feedback on their performance.
  - **Restart Button**: Added functionality to allow users to restart the challenge, providing flexibility to try again without refreshing the page or reloading the app.
- The project is still ongoing with more updates planned. User feedback, ideas, and suggestions for future improvements are always welcome!

Looking forward to seeing how this evolves and refining the experience based on user interaction.
